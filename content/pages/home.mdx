Hello! I'm Pascalrr, your average enby kittycoded programmer on the interwebs.
I like to make things sometimes but I'm not very good at it lol.

{/* section:about */}
import '@components/popover'

Hi, I'm Cayden, or Kay! I'm a 17 year old high school (and college) student who likes to make things online. I'm not very good at it, but I do it.
I also enjoy singing, and sometimes playing video games. I stream games and code, although I haven't streamed or uploaded a video in a couple of years.
I'll talk about my shenanigans here, and sometimes I write on <PopOver content="technically Misskey... but technically Sharkey">Mastodon</PopOver> too.
I maintain a few projects, including packaging for my favorite browser Waterfox, a cross-platform <PopOver content="FIRST Robotics Competition">FRC</PopOver> Driver Staton, some CLI and server applications,
plus this website and a Home Assistant Addon. You can read my blog posts and project pages about those things here.
